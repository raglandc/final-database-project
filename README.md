## Database Design Final Project

This is the submitted project for our (Pedro Bautista, Christiana Hellenbrand, Christopher Ragland) Database Design course at the University of South Florida. 

## Project Description

We are tasked with building a full-stack application that incorporates a user interface and processes for connecting to, retrieving from, and making changes to a relational database. 

All team members agreed on creating a small movie database that allows the following features:
  - create a user profile
  - users can search movies that are present in the database
  - users are able to add movies to their personal "Watchlist" as well as "Favorites"
  - users are able to remove moves from their personal "Watchlist" as well as "Favorites"
  
  more information can be found inside the project documentation.

## Documentation

Below is the document containing information pertaining to the project structure and design including entity-relationship-diagrams. 

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
